											<h3>Application and entire agreement</h3>
											<p>1.	These terms and conditions apply to the provision of the services detailed in our client agreement.</p>
											<p>2.	You are deemed to have accepted these Terms and Conditions when you accept our client agreement.</p>
											<p>3.	You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or out on our behalf. These conditions apply to the contract to the exclusion of any other terms that you try to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.</p>
										
											<h3>Interpretation</h3>
											<p>4.	A “business day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday and national bank holidays in England and Wales.</p>
											<p>5.	The headings in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and do not affect their interpretation.</p>
											<p>6.	Words imparting the singular number shall include the plural and vice-versa.</p>
											<h3>Services</h3>
											<p>7.	We warrant that we will use reasonable care and skill in our performance of the services which will comply with the client agreement, including any specification in all material respects. We can make any changes to the services which are necessary to comply with any applicable law or safety requirement, and we will notify you if this is necessary.</p>
											<p>8.	We will use our reasonable endeavours to complete the performance of the services within the time agreed or as set out in the client agreement; however, time shall not be of the essence in the performance of our obligations. </p>
											<p>9.	All of these Terms and Conditions apply to the supply of any goods as well as services unless we specify otherwise within a client agreement or project plan.</p>
											<h3>Your obligations</h3>
											<p>10.	You must obtain any permissions, consents, licences or otherwise that we need and must give us with access to any and all relevant information, materials, properties and any other matters which we need to provide the services.</p>
											<p>11.	If you do not comply with clause 10, we reserve the right to terminate services without an advance warning.</p>
											<p>12.	We are not liable for any delay or failure to provide the services if this is caused by your failure to comply with the provisions of this section (Your obligation). </p>
											<p>13.	The service that we provide operates a primary online/cloud service (remote working), therefore you are required to provide at least three business days notice for an on-site visit. </p>
											<p>14.	If an on-site visit is cancelled within 24 hours or failure to be present for an on-site visit without a valid reason on multiple occasions, we reserve the right to terminate service without an advance warning.</p>
											
											<h3>Fees</h3>
											<p>15.	The fees for the services are set out in the client agreement and are frozen during the agreed time frame.</p>
											<p>16.	In addition to the fees, we can recover from you </p>
											<p>16.1.	Reasonable incidental expenses including, but not limited to, travelling expenses, hotel costs, subsistence and any associated expenses. </p>
											<p>16.2.	The cost of services provided by third parties and required by us for the performance of the services.</p>
											<p>16.3.	The cost of any materials required for the provision of the services.</p>
											<p>17.	You must pay us for any additional services provided by us that are specified in the client agreement in accordance with our then current, applicable rate in effect at the time of performance or such other rate as may be agreed between us. The provisions of clause 16 also apply to these additional services. </p>
											<p>18.	The fees are of any applicable VAT and other taxes or levies which are imposed or charged by any competent authority.</p>
											<p>19.	A rolling contract of monthly fees (this includes hourly fee and access fee) will always be totalled and invoiced at the end of a calendar month.</p>
											<p>20.	Invoices will be sent at the start of the calendar month (or the first business day of a new month) regarding the previous month of fees (hourly rate and access fee). Payment terms and conditions are set out in the clause below (Payment).</p>

											<p></p>
											<h3>Cancellation and amendment</h3>
											<p>21.	We can withdraw, cancel or amend a client agreement if it has not been accepted by you, or if the services have not started, within a period of 28 calendar days from the date of the client agreement, (unless the client agreement has been withdrawn).</p>
											<p>22.	Either we or you cancel an order with or without a reason prior to your acceptance (or rejection) of the client agreement.</p>
											<p>23.	If you want to amend any details of the services you must tell us in writing (email) as soon as possible. We will use reasonable endeavours to make any required changes and additional costs will be included in the fees and invoiced to you.</p>
											<p>24.	If, due to circumstances beyond our control, including those set out in the clause below (Circumstances beyond a party’s control), we have to make any changes in the services or how they are provided, we will notify you immediately. We will use reasonable endeavours to keep any such changes to a minimum.</p>	
											<p>25.	If you wish to cancel a client agreement;</p>
											<p>25.1.	For 30 day rolling contract: If you wish to cancel services during an active term period, you will still be charged the set access fee which you have agreed from the client agreement for the corresponding month of the cancellation request.</p>
											<p>25.2.	For a set project base contract: If you wish to cancel services during an active project, the initial first half payment will still be charged and will be invalid for a refund. Any additional fees at which Ravnar LTD needs to expense to the client will be invoiced at which you must pay within 2 weeks of the cancelation date. </p>
											<h3>Payment</h3>
										
											<p>26. We will invoice you for payment of the fees either:</p>
